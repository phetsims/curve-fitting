# Implementation notes for "Curve Fitting" (curve-fitting)

## Model

The model of curve-fitting uses a series of AXON properties to update the curve. Each data point is represented in the
model as `Point`. `Point` stores its position and error. Each data point is kept in the observable array Points that
handles the coming and going of data points.

`Points` is used extensively in calculation of the regression coefficients. `Points` is responsible for filtering out
irrelevant points.

`Curve` determines the coefficients of the polynomial in an array called coefficients. The slider parameters (for '
Adjustable Fit') can be passed as coefficients or calculated based on least squares regression (for 'Best Fit'). `Curve`
calculates the r-squared and chi-squared deviations according to the weighted chi-squared regression.

For 'Adjustable Fit', the standard r-squared value can be negative. For the purposes of this simulation, in cases of a
negative r-squared, the r-squared value is shown to be zero. The classical chi-squared equation is equal to zero when
the number of points is less than the number of degrees of freedom (i.e order of polynomial + 1), since a 'Best Fit'
curve would go through all the data points in most circumstances. For the purpose of this simulation, in 'Adjustable
Fit' mode, the chi-squared value is not assumed to be zero in such situations (See Curve.js for more details).

`CurveShape` converts the polynomial of the curve into a series of small lines.

## View

`BucketNode` is responsible for handling the points coming out of the bucket.

Almost none of the nodes need to be disposed because they are instantiated a finite number of times and last for the
duration of the sim. `PointNode` is the exception as it needs a dispose, and it gets disposed in `BucketNode`.

This simulation includes query parameters in `CurveFittingQueryParameters` that are useful for debugging and should be
shared with the QA team.
